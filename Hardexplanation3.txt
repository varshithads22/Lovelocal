Hard-3:

Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Logic:

1.Initialization:

Initialize a variable count to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the count of digit '1' in the numbers.

2.Iteration:

Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). The loop variable i represents the current number being processed.

3.Counting:

Convert the current number i to a string using str(i).
Use the count method on the string to count the occurrences of the digit '1'.
Add the count to the overall count variable.

4.Result:

The function returns the final count, which represents the total occurrences of the digit '1' in all numbers from 1 to n.


Algorithm:

Algorithm: count_digit_one(n)
Input: A positive integer n

Output: The count of occurrences of the digit '1' in numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)

1. Initialize a variable count to 0.
2. Iterate through numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) using a for loop with loop variable i:
   a. Convert i to a string.
   b. Count the occurrences of '1' in the string representation of i.
   c. Add the count to the overall count variable.
3. Return the final count as the result.
